# Identify_B.anthracis
AGILE V1.1
(Anthracis Genome-based Identification with high-fideLity E-probe)

This version is for Windows users, one-click identification of Bacillus anthracis. Users do not need to write code.

Identify_B.anthracis is a tool based python that employs a combination of * in silico * the 9 specific tags of Bacillus anthracis to rapidly identify * B.anthracis *  isolates using nucleotide sequencing data.

Decompress agile.zip, Open agile_start Shortcut, click Select File to open the sequencing file or click Select Folder to load sequence of whole folder.The common nucleic acid sequences can be loaded

Note that office files in .doc, .xls, .ppt and other formats cannot be loaded.

After entering the sequencing results,  clicking open means start identification.

Click on the result to export, output the result, and  select export location and enter the file name, complete the analysis.

The last column in the result file is the identification result, whether it is Ba or not Ba, deterministic.

The identification result is determined based on whether the specific tags of Bacillus anthracis are searched. The more tags are searched, the more reliable the target sample is positive.
